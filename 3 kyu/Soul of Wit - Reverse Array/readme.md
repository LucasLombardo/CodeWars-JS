## 3 kyu: The Soul of Wit - Reverse an Array

Link to problem on CodeWars: https://www.codewars.com/kata/the-soul-of-wit-reverse-an-array/javascript

### Problem Instructions

No time for stories. Reverse an array, return the result. Do whatever you want with the original array. Don't use Array.prototype.reverse. You have 30 bytes to spare.

Example: [1, 2, 3] â†’ [3, 2, 1]

And this time you won't be able to do the thing from that kata. require isn't allowed as well.
