Link to problem on CodeWars: https://www.codewars.com/kata/love-vs-friendship/javascript

### Problem Instructions

If ã€€ a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 ... z = 26

Then l + o + v + e = 54

and f + r + i + e + n + d + s + h + i + p = 108

So friendship is twice stronger than love :-)

The input will always be in lowercase and never be empty.
